## Overview Example 

Here you can observe the operations performable on each SQL table and their various methods.
Each have their own `Display` implementations which can be observed in running the code through `cargo run`.

Setting up SQL is as follows:
- Run the docker-compose.yaml file using `docker compose up (-d for a daemon process)`
- Giving the SQL server a bit to initialize, follow it with `cargo run`.
- Observe the result :D
